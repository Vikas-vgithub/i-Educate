            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is commonly subdivided into different types. The most common
                subdivision is between formal, non-formal, and informal education. However, some
                theorists only distinguish between formal and informal education. A process of teaching constitutes
                formal education if it happens in a complex institutionalized framework. Such frameworks are usually
                chronologically and hierarchically organized as in modern schooling systems, which have different
                classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from primary school to university. Because
                of its scale, formal education is usually controlled and guided by a governmental entity and is normally
                compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education plays a central role in modern civilization. But in
                primitive cultures, most of the education happens not on the formal but on the informal
                level. This usually means that there is no distinction between activities focused on
                education and other activities. Instead, the whole environment may be seen as a form of school and many
                or all adults may act as teachers. An important reason for moving to formal forms of education is due to
                the sheer quantity of knowledge to be passed on, which requires both a formal setting and well-trained
                teachers to be transmitted effectively.</p>
